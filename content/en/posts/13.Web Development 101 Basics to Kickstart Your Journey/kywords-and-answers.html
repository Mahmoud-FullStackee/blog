<h3 class="faq-question">What is the difference between a server and a browser?</h3>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>The server and the browser are two essential elements in the process of browsing the Internet, but each has a different role.</p>
<p>The browser is the application that users use to access websites, such as Google Chrome or Firefox, and it displays web pages and allows interaction with them.</p>
<p>When a user requests a specific page, the browser sends a request to the server.</p>
<p>The server is the device or system that hosts the website and contains its files and data, and prepares the content and sends it to the browser upon request.</p>
<p>Simply put, the browser displays the content to the user, while the server stores this content and serves it when requested.</p>
